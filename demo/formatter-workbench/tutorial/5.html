<h2>Data editor</h2>
This editor let’s you adjust the data shown in the grid.
<ul>
  <li>The initial contents is the actual data shown in the grid instance above it.</li>
  <li>After editing the data, bind it to the grid by clicking <code class="button">grid.setData(…)</code>.</li>
  <li>The grid in turn is bound to the data window: Any edits made to cells (via cell editors) will alter the contents of this editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In actual practice, when data is set using <code>setData</code>, it typically has come from a data store, typically as a character string in JSON format.
  If that is the case, you would probably call <code>JSON.parse</code> on it, rather than <code>eval</code>; and pass the result to <code>setData</code>.
  In this workbench, we’re using straight JavaScript, not JSON, which is why we’re using using <code>eval</code>, not <code>JSON.parse</code>.
  When editing, therefore, you do not have to worry about strict adherence to the JSON standard (double quotes, primitive types, _etc._).
